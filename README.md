- ⚡ Fun fact: ...Sure! Here's a fun fact: Octopuses have three hearts. Two pump blood to the gills, while the third pumps it to the rest of the body. Interestingly, the heart that pumps to the body stops beating when the octopus swims, which might explain why they prefer crawling to conserve energy! 🐙 Isn't nature fascinating?
